# LDAPWrapper
A limited Objective-C interface to some LDAP Functions to support the CertificateSleuth Application.

This is mostly here for archival purposes. This was used to simplify the inteface to the LDAP libraries on an OS X system for a companion Application called CertificateSleuth. 

Apple has deprecated the OpenLDAP C API in favor of its OpenDirectory framework. However, that framework overly complicates what was trying to be accomplished, and the original need for the CerificateSleuth application has abated.
