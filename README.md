# LDAPWrapper
A limited Objective-C interface to some LDAP Functions to support the [CertificateSleuth](https://github.com/cyberdork33/CertificateSleuth) Application.

This is mostly here for archival purposes. This was used to simplify the inteface to the LDAP libraries on an OS X system for a companion application called [CertificateSleuth](https://github.com/cyberdork33/CertificateSleuth). 

Apple has deprecated the OpenLDAP C API in favor of its OpenDirectory framework. However, that framework overly complicates what was trying to be accomplished, and the original need for the [CertificateSleuth](https://github.com/cyberdork33/CertificateSleuth) application has abated.

The code is well documented and I no longer plan to maintain it.
